# Waves
🚀 Inspiration
In this pandemic it has become more and more apparent that mental health preservation is difficult for everybody because of a lack of social interaction.

🏭 What it does
Waves runs you through a series of meditation and yoga exercises to improve upon your mental health and start/continue your journey towards a better person.

⚙️ How I built it
I first started with the timer page, and then that broke so I made about 8 new renditions of it and decided to include some other pages and exercises.

🧠 What I learned
I learned a lot of css tricks to make the page more appealing and basics of javascript.

🔮 What's next for Waves
 I am thinking about implementing more features like tracking your progress, potentially a journaling feature, and a sleep tracker
